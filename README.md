# Python-Project-2

A game I led the creation of as a project 4 years ago, in the 12th grade. The code is not very good because it was my 2nd ever attempt at making a game and I was still rather new to coding when I made this.

This game uses Python 3 and SQL 8; you will need the same or newer verisons of both of these programs installed for this game to function. You will also need to change the various SQL requirements like server name and password for it to work.
