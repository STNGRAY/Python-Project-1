# Python-Project-2

A game I led the creation of as a project in the 12th grade. The code is not very good because it was my 2nd ever attempt at making a game and I was still rather new to coding when I made this.

This game uses Python 3, SQL 8 and the MySQL connector for python; you will need the same or newer verisons of all of these programs installed for this game to function. You will also need to change the various SQL requirements in the code like server name and password for it to work.

I dont plan on working on or improving this code at the moment.
