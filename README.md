# Python-Project-2

A game I made for a project in the 12th grade. The code is not very good; alot of stuff is repeated and could be done much easier, but this was my 2nd ever attempt at making a game and I was still new to coding when I made this.

This program is the first project I am uploading, but is named project 2 instead of 1. This is because I made my first ever python project in the 11th grade (a terrible game that used the Math.random function extensively), but I lost the files for it :( .
