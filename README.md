# Python-Project-2
A (bad) game I made for a project in the 12th grade

This program is the first project I am uploading, but is project 2 instead of 1. This is because I made my first ever python project in the 11th grade (a terrible game that used the Math.random function extensively), but I lost the files for it :( .
